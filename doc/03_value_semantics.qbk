[section Pimpl with Value Semantics]

['Pimpl] with ['value semantics] exhibits different relationship with the underlying data and behaves as a ['unique-proxy]. It solely owns and manages the data (rather than shares). Consequently, for such ['Pimpls] manual implementation gets more involved and might look as follows:

 struct Book
 {
   ~Book ();
    Book (string const& title, string const& author);
    Book (Book const&);
    Book& operator=(Book const&);
  
    string const&  title() const;
    string const& author() const;
    
    // If Books need to be comparable
    bool operator==(Book const&) const;
    bool operator!=(Book const&) const;
  
    private:
  
    struct implementation;
    implementation* impl_;
 };

In the example above it is only natural and reasonable to deploy ['std::unique_ptr<implementation>] instead of the raw ['implementation*] ([link 13 \[13\]], [link 14 \[14\]]). It needs to be mentioned though that ['std::unique_ptr] has been developed with certain (and very different from ['std::shared_ptr]) goals in mind -- no overhead and maximum efficiency -- and intentionally avoids the overhead of the incomplete-type management. Consequently, the explicit copy constructor, the assignment operator and the explicit non-inlined destructor are still our responsibility: 

 struct Book
 {
   ~Book ();
    Book (string const& title, string const& author);
    Book (Book const&);
    Book& operator=(Book const&);
  
    string const&  title() const;
    string const& author() const;
    
    // If Books need to be comparable
    bool operator==(Book const&) const;
    bool operator!=(Book const&) const;
  
    private:
  
    struct implementation;
    std::unique_ptr<implementation> impl_;
 };

['std::shared_ptr] implements the incomplete-type management functionality and is deployed for the ['Pimpls] with pointer semantics. Similarly the internal ['pimpl::value_ptr] also implements the incomplete-type management technique (originally by Peter Dimov) and is deployed for the ['Pimpls] with value semantics. Consequently, the code above shrinks down to: 

 struct Book : public pimpl<Book>::unique
 {
    Book(string const& title, string const& author);
    
    string const&  title() const;
    string const& author() const;

    // If Books need to be comparable
    bool operator==(Book const&) const;
    bool operator!=(Book const&) const;
 };

with auto-generated copy constructor, assignment operator, destructor, with no private-part implementation detail, no loss in functionality and with the same benefits as before -- shorter, application-focused and reasonably self-documented.

A notable difference (compared to pointer-semantics classes) is that the comparison operators are not freebies. In fact, they are never freebies (they are never auto-generated). However, in the case of the pointer-semantics classes those comparison operators are reduced to pointer comparisons and generalized. That's not the case with the value-semantics classes. Consequently, for value-semantics classes the comparison operators become part of the ['user-provided interface] (if such a class needs to be comparable).
  
So far both examples of ['Pimpl]-based ['Book] classes (with pointer- and value-semantics) look almost identical and internal implementations (as we'll see later) are as close. That property is important for orderly and healthy evolution of commercial large-scale systems as it allows to minimize the impact of a requirement change -- something as inevitable as "death and taxes".
